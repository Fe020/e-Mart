        As of now, there is no official information or confirmation from Apple regarding the release of an iPhone 15. Apple typically releases a new iPhone model every year in September, and the most recent model as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021 was the iPhone 13.

However, based on the usual pattern of iPhone upgrades and rumors, the iPhone 15, if released, may feature upgrades to the camera system, processor, display, and possibly battery life. It may also introduce new features such as improved augmented reality capabilities, a foldable design, or 5G support.

But again, I must emphasize that any information about the iPhone 15 at this point is purely speculative, and it is best to wait for official announcements from Apple regarding the release of a new iPhone model.
